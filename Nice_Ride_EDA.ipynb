We'll use Bokeh to plot the number of outbound trips, inbound trips, and the difference in demand in three separate tabs.  The color and area of the circles represent the vaue (number of outbound trips, inbound trips, or the difference) in the corresponding tab.  For the \"Difference\", the size of the circle represents the *absolute* difference (so we can see which stations are the most imbalanced, and the color tells us in which direction they are imbalanced)."

      "source": "In the \"Difference\" tab, we can immediately identify some problem stations.  There are some stations at which far more people are ending their trips than starting them (e.g. the station at Lake St & Knox Ave, at the northeast corner of Bde Maka Ska, or the Minnehaha Park station).  There are also stations at which far more people are *starting* their trips than ending them (e.g. the stations at Coffman Union and Wiley Hall on the Univeristy of Minnesota campus).  But the majority of stations have about as many inbound as outbound rides (e.g. the two stations by Como Lake, which you can barely see on the differences map!).  \n\nPlotting the difference in demand by location also reveals an interesting rental flow pattern: it appears that, on average, more rides start from downtown Minneapolis or the U of M campus and go away from downtown.  Notice how there's a lot of large blue circles (stations with more outbound rides) clustered around downtown Minneapolis, but most of the large red circles (stations with more inbound rides) lie away from downtown, and tend to be \"destinations\" and parks (such as Minnehaha Park, Bde Maka Ska, Logan Park, and North Mississippi Regional Park)\n\n<a id='difference-in-demand'></a>\n### Difference in demand\n\nIs this difference in demand going to be a problem for Nice Ride?  Ideally, Nice Ride will want to have more docks at stations where there is large difference between the number of incoming and outgoing rides.  This is because if more rides are starting at a given station than ending there, the number of bikes at that station will decrease as the day goes on.  So, there needs to be enough docks at that station to hold enough bikes so the station isn't empty by the end of the day!  On the other hand, if more rides are *ending* at a station than are beginning there, all the docks at that station will fill up and people won't be able to end their rides there!  So those stations must have enough docks to absorb the amount of incoming traffic over the course of a day.\n\nStations which have a good balance of the number of rides coming in to the number of rides going out don't need quite as many docks - because about as many bikes are being taken from that station as are being left there.  Of course, there's also the issue of time - some stations may see different demand depending on the time of day, week, or season - but we'll get to that later. With a good match of the number of docks at each station to the difference between incoming and outgoing trips, Nice Ride won't have to spend as much time during prime riding hours re-distributing bikes from low-demand stations (with extra unused bikes) to high-demand stations (with not enough bikes!).  How well does this distribution of demand differences match up with the distribution of the number of docks at each station? "

      "source": "There's a pretty obvious commuter trend.  Stations downtown and at the Univeristy of Minnesota have more incoming rides during the morning rush hour (~7-8am), while residential areas surrounding downtown have more outbound rides.  During the evening commute however (~4-5pm), stations downtown and at the U of M are depleted and there is an influx of rides to stations in surrounding residential areas.\n\nThis pattern can actually work in Nice Ride's favor.  Suppose a station has a bunch of bikes leaving in the morning.  As long as there were lots of bikes there in the morning, if they all come back in the evening, then that's great for Nice Ride - they don't have to re-distribute the bikes to that station! The only time when bike distribution problems arise is when (1) there is an imbalance in the ride distribution on average, or (2) there aren't enough docks at a station to buffer the daily fluxuations in demand at that station. \n\nEarlier we looked at which stations have imbalances in the ride distribution on average (the horizontal bar plot with difference in demand and # docks for each station).  That analysis tells us about which stations we can expect to see become depleted over the course of the day, and *not* be replenished, or vice versa.  This problem can be alleviated at a given station by increasing the number of docks at a station, but that won't *fix* the problem.  Even with a large number of docks at a station, the imbalance will add up over time.  No matter what, Nice Ride will have to re-distribute bikes to/from these stations.  That's why we shouldn't worry as much about trying to match the number of docks at a station to its demand difference on average.  However, the other problem *can* be fixed by optimizing the number of docks at each station.  \n\n<a id='cumulative-difference'></a>\n### Cumulative difference in demand\n\nThat second problem is the issue of the demand changing over time.  Even when a station has an even balance in inbound to outbund trips on average, we want there to be enough docks at a station to buffer imbalances that happen over the course of a day.  For example, suppose a station has, on average, 10 outbound rentals in the morning, and then 10 inbound rentals in the afternoon.  There's a perfect balance on average, so Nice Ride doesn't have to worry too much about re-distributing bikes to or from that station.  \n\nBut only if the station has enough docks!  What if the station only has 5 docks?  Then the station will run out of available bikes halfway through the morning, and Nice Ride will have to bring 5 bikes to the station from some other station so that more people can rent from that station.  If they don't, Nice Ride will miss out on revenue!  And in the afternoon, the station will fill up, and Nice Ride will have to take 5 bikes *away* from the station to a different station, so that there are empty docks where people can end their rides.  If they don't, customers will be pissed that they can't end their ride where they wanted to.  So if the station doesn't have enough docks, Nice Ride will have to re-distribute bikes to and from that station *every day!*\n\nWe need to optimize the number of docks at each station in order to minimize the amount of bike re-distribution that's required.  To do that, we'll take a look at the cumulative difference in demand at each station.  The cumulative difference in demand is, at a given time of day, how many more (or less) bikes are at station than were there at the beginning of the day.  Using this analysis, we can answer some important questions about bike re-distribution of bikes at each station:\n- Which stations have a large imbalance?\n- In which direction is that imbalance? (i.e. does Nice Ride need to bring bikes to that station, or take them away?)\n- When is that imbalance worst?\n- What is the optimal number of bikes to have at each station at the beginning of the day?\n- What is the optimal number of docks to have at each station?\n\nLet's compute the cumulative difference in demand at each station.  We'll also normalize by the number of days in the Nice Ride season, so that our values reflect how many bikes are at each station across time on an average day (relative to the number of bikes that were there at the beginning of the day)."

      "source": "From this plot we can see which stations have the largest imbalances of incoming to outbound rides (stations with dark red or blue), the direction of that imbalance (red=more bikes, blue=less bikes), and at what time during the day that imbalance is the worst.  \n\nUsing this matrix, we could work out the best times to move bikes between stations, how many to move, and between which stations.  Unfortunately the times at which Nice Ride actually re-distributed bikes isn't included in the historical datset, although that information could be collected from their [General Bikeshare Feed](https://api-core.niceridemn.org/gbfs/gbfs.json).\n\n<a id='optimal-initial-number'></a>\n### Optimal initial number of bikes\n\nWe can also use this cumulative difference information to figure out the optimal number of bikes to have at each station at the beginning of the day.  We want to minimize the amount of time that stations are empty when customers are wanting to rent, and the amount of time stations are full when customers are wanting to return their rentals.  To do that we'll define a \"loss\" function for each station.  This loss function takes a hypothetical initial number of bikes, and returns a value which is higher when a station is close to being full and there are more inbound trips than outbound trips, and also higher when a station is close to being empty and there are more outbound trips than inbound trips:\n\n$$ \nL(N_0) = \\int_t \\alpha \\max(0, D_t) \\exp ( N_0 + C_t - N_d ) - (1-\\alpha) \\min(0, D_t) \\exp ( - N_0 - C_t )  ~ dt\n$$\n\nwhere \n\n- $L(N_0)$ is the loss of starting with N_0 docks at the beginning of the day\n- $D_t$ is the demand difference at time $t$ (inbound rides minus outbound rides)\n- $C_t$ is the cumulative demand difference ($C_t = \\int_0^t D_x ~ dx$)\n- $N_d$ is the number of docks at the station\n- $\\alpha$ is a parameter which controls how bad it is for a station to be full vs being empty\n\nLet's look at each part of that overly-complicated equation.  The integral in the loss equation sums over all the hours of a day (but you could use a finer time bin if you wanted to).  The first half of what's inside the integral ($\\alpha \\max(0, D_t) \\exp ( N_0 + C(t) - N_d )$) is a value which will be large when the station is close to being full and there are more inbound rides than outbound rides.  $\\max(0, D_t)$ is just the difference in demand, but only when it's positive (and 0 when it's negative).  $N_0 + C(t) - N_d$ is the (negative of the) expected number of *empty docks* left at the station.  That way, when the expected number of empty docks at the station is very low, $\\exp ( N_0 + C_t - N_d )$ will be very high, and vice-versa.  So, when the expected number of empty docks at the station is low *and* the number of inbound trips is high, the value of $\\max(0, D_t) \\exp ( N_0 + C_t - N_d )$ will be large.\n\nBut we also want to penalize having an empty station when people want to rent bikes!  The second half of what's in the integral ($- (1-\\alpha) \\min(0, D_t) \\exp ( - N_0 - C_t )$) is a value which will be large when the station is close to being empty and there are more outbound rides than inbound rides.  $\\min(0, D_t)$ is the difference in demand, but only when it's negative (and 0 when it's positive).  $(- N_0 - C_t)$ is the (negative of the) expected number of bikes left at the station.  That way, when the expected number of bikes available at a station is low, $\\exp ( - N_0 - C_t )$ will be very high, and vice-versa.  So when the expected number of available bikes at the station is low *and* the number of outbound trips his high, the value of $- \\min(0, D_t) \\exp ( - N_0 - C_t )$ will be large.\n\nThe $\\alpha$ parameter controls how bad it is to have stations fill up with bikes compared to running out of bikes, and should take values between 0 and 1.  If $\\alpha<0.5$, that means we consider it \"more bad\" when the station is empty but there are people wanting to rent from that station than when it is full and people are wanting to end their rides there.  I'm going to set $\\alpha=0.3$, because to me it seems slightly worse to have a station be empty when someone wants to rent a bike than to have a station be full where someone wants to return a bike.  Either way the customer is pissed, but if the station they want to rent from is empty, they probably won't end up renting a bike, and Nice Ride will miss out on revenue.  If the station they want to return their bike to is full, they'll just have to find another station and return it there.\n\nLet's compute the optimal number of bikes for each station to have at the beginning of the day using that loss function."
